# Status:
#	not working shells:
#				esh (http://slon.ttk.ru/esh/)
#
#  shells:
#		bash:	works fine
#		csh:	token is not echoed after echo a ENV var => timeout but ok
#		ksh:	error on long strings; the token is not echoed
#		tcsh:	works fine
#		zsh:	works fine; causes sometime issuses (some \a in output, etc)
#				depending on the prompt; issues with syntax highlighting;
#				=> so it is disabled by default
#				NOT working with oh-my-zsh!
#		esh:	does not work because the ; following token is not echoed
#		sash:	works fine (added some extra commands)
#		dash:	works fine
#	    remote:	works fine (no echo shell via ssh user@host bash; similar to
#	    many shellcodes)
